# P5-Table-Editor
Tool to edit .ftd files from Persona 5 for translation or wathever you want.
This is my firt project coding, so expect lots of bugs and strange behavior. The code is a mess and there is probably a better way to do all of this, feel free to suggest changes so i can learn.

Now with a GUI made with QT! (The command line version is still available)

Also some comments are in spanish, I should translate them later...
